    "## Our solution\n",
    "Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange between Alice and Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our attack script, `mitm.py`, acts as a transparent proxy with malicious intent:\n",
    "1.  Interception: It listens on two specific ports to intercept connections intended for Alice and Bob.\n",
    "2.  Key Replacement:\n",
    "    - When Bob connects, `mitm.py` intercepts his public key ($g^y$) and sends him a fake public key ($g^z$).\n",
    "    - When Alice connects, `mitm.py` sends her the fake public key ($g^z$) and intercepts her real public key ($g^x$).\n",
    "3.  Result: Alice and Bob believe they have a secure connection with each other, but they have actually established separate shared secrets with the attacker.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Execution Instructions\n",
    "The code can be found in the Q1 folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please execute the files in separate terminals in the following order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run the Scripts\n",
    "Open your terminal and run the scripts in this specific order to ensure listeners are active before connections are attempted:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Start the Attacker:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python3 mitm.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2.  **Start Alice:** (Alice waits for a connection, so she must start before Bob)\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python3 alice.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  **Start Bob:** (Bob initiates the connection cycle)\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python3 bob.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Expected Output\n",
    "In the `mitm.py` terminal window, you will see:\n",
    "* Interception of `GY` from Bob.\n",
    "* Interception of `GX` from Alice.\n",
    "* **Success Message:** Displaying the two compromised shared secrets (one shared with Alice, one shared with Bob)."
