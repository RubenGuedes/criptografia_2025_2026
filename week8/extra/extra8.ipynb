    "# Q1: Authenticated Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution implements the authenticated encryption scheme as specified in the assignment. It consists of three Python scripts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`gen.py`**: Generates the pre-shared keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`bob.py`**: Acts as the TCP server, listening for a connection from Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **`alice.py`**: Acts as the TCP client, connecting to Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation adheres to all specified security requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Generation**: `gen.py` creates a file named `pw` containing two symmetric keys:\n",
    "    - **16-byte (128-bit) key** for AES-128 encryption.\n",
    "    - **32-byte (256-bit) key** for HMAC-SHA256 authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Confidentiality**: All messages are encrypted using **AES-128-CTR**. A new random 8-byte `nonce` is generated for each message.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Authenticity**: Message authenticity is ensured using **HMAC-SHA256**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scheme**: The system uses the **Encrypt-then-MAC** (EtM) scheme. The HMAC is calculated over the `nonce` and the `ciphertext` (`nonce + ciphertext`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replay Protection**: A **sequence number** (implemented as an 8-byte counter) is prepended to the plaintext before encryption to protect against replay attacks. Both Alice and Bob maintain separate `send` and `receive` counters to ensure messages are processed in the correct order (Encrypt-then-MAC).\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle variable-length messages over TCP, the following custom protocol is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Send**:\n",
    "    1.  Plaintext is prepended with the 8-byte sequence number: `plaintext = seq_num_bytes + message_bytes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  This plaintext is encrypted with AES-CTR, producing a `ciphertext` and a `nonce`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.  An HMAC is calculated over the `nonce + ciphertext`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4.  The final payload is constructed: `payload = nonce + ciphertext + mac`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5.  A 4-byte length prefix (the length of the `payload`) is sent, followed by the `payload` itself.\n",
    "2.  **Receive**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.  The receiver reads the 4-byte length prefix.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.  It then reads the exact number of bytes specified by the length prefix.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.  The received `payload` is split into `nonce`, `ciphertext`, and `mac`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4.  The HMAC is verified. If it fails, the program exits.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5.  The `ciphertext` is decrypted using the `nonce`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    6.  The 8-byte sequence number is extracted from the decrypted plaintext and verified against the expected sequence number. If it doesn't match, the program exits.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    7.  The original message is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Run the Q1 Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Install the required library:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install pycryptodome\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2.  Save `gen.py`, `bob.py`, and `alice.py` in the same directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Open Terminal 1.**\n",
    "2.  Generate the keys:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python gen.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  Start the server (it will start listening on the defined port):\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python bob.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    *Output:* `Bob is listening on localhost:65432...`\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Open Terminal 2.**\n",
    "5.  Run the client:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python alice.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversation will execute in both terminals, and each will display `Conversation successful and complete.`"
