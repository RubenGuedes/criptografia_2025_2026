    "# Q1: Authenticated Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution found in `Q1/` implements the authenticated encryption scheme as specified in the assignment. It consists of three Python scripts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`gen.py`**: Generates the pre-shared keys.\n",
    "2.  **`bob.py`**: Acts as the TCP server, listening for a connection from Alice.\n",
    "3.  **`alice.py`**: Acts as the TCP client, connecting to Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Open Terminal 1.**\n",
    "2.  Generate the keys:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python gen.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  Start the server:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python bob.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    *Output:* `Bob is listening on localhost:65432...`\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Open Terminal 2.**\n",
    "5.  Run the client:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python alice.py\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "### Result\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversation will execute in both terminals. Each step will log the secure sending/receiving of messages, culminating in `Conversation successful and complete.`"

    "\n",
    "Text taken from the book \"Serious Cryptography\", page 188, from Breaking Textbook RSA Signatures:  \n",
    "\"One such attack involves a trivial forgery: upon noticing that $0^{d} \\mod{n} = 0$, $1^{d} \\mod{n} = 1$, and $(n-1)^{d} \\mod{n} = n-1$, regardless of the value of the private key $d$, an attacker can forge signatures of 0, 1, or (n-1) without knowing $d$.\"\n",

    "FDH (Full Domain Hash) solves the forgery problem by hashing the message before signing it. Instead of signing the message directly, the signer computes the signature as:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma = H(M)^d \\bmod N\n",
