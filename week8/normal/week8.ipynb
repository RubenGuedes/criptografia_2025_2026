    "# Exercise 4: The Miller-Rabin Primality Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 4 asks for a Python program based on the strategy described in the provided text. This strategy is the **Miller-Rabin primality test**, which is a probabilistic test utilized to efficiently determine if a large number $n$ is prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm relies on the logic established in Theorems 1 and 2 of the text. The process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Decomposition**:\n",
    "    First, we take the number $n-1$ (where $n$ is the number we want to test) and write it in the form $n-1 = 2^k d$, where $d$ is an odd number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Witness Selection**:\n",
    "    We pick a random integer $a$ (the \"witness\") such that $1 < a < n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Test Conditions**:\n",
    "    According to Theorem 2, if $n$ is prime, then one of the following conditions must be true:\n",
    "    * $a^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$\n",
    "    * $a^{2^i d} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{n}$ for some $i$ in the range $0 \\le i \\le k-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Conclusion**:\n",
    "    * If $a$ satisfies **either** of these conditions, it is not a witness to $n$'s compositeness, and $n$ might be prime.\n",
    "    * If $a$ satisfies **neither** condition, it *is* a witness. We have definitively proven that $n$ is composite.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Iteration**:\n",
    "    We repeat this test $m$ times with $m$ different random witnesses. If $n$ passes all $m$ tests, we can be confident it is prime with a probability of $1 - 2^{-m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A python implementation of this test can be found at **miller-rabbin.py**."
