    "### (a) \n",
    "\n",
    "When a client (Bob) receives a public-key certificate from a web server (Alice), the accepted\n",
    "procedure is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check the server identity**  \n",
    "   The client verifies that the identity contained in the certificate is correct for the\n",
    "   intended server (for example, the DNS name of the web server).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check the validity period**  \n",
    "   The client verifies that the current time is within the certificate’s validity interval\n",
    "   (start and end dates).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check certificate meta-information**  \n",
    "   The client verifies that the certificate’s meta-information and extensions make sense for\n",
    "   the intended application (for example, key usage, basic constraints).  \n",
    "   If a critical extension is present and not recognized, the certificate must be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verify the CA’s signature**  \n",
    "   The client obtains the public key of the issuing Certification Authority (CA) and verifies\n",
    "   the digital signature on the certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Establish trust in the CA (certificate chain validation)**  \n",
    "   If the CA is not directly trusted, the client iteratively validates the certificate chain\n",
    "   until reaching a trusted root CA that is implicitly trusted (pre-installed in the system).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Accept or reject the certificate**  \n",
    "   If all checks succeed, the client accepts the certificate and uses the server’s public key.\n",
    "   Otherwise, the certificate is rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (b) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Certificate revocation** is the process of invalidating a public-key certificate before the\n",
    "end of its validity period. Certificates that are outside their validity dates are automatically\n",
    "invalid, but revocation is required when a certificate must be considered invalid while it still\n",
    "appears valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reasons for certificate revocation\n",
    "A certificate may need to be revoked when:\n",
    "- The secret (private) key associated with the certificate is lost or compromised.\n",
    "- There is a data breach affecting the secrecy of the key.\n",
    "- The information contained in the certificate (identity or meta-data) becomes incorrect.\n",
    "- The certificate can no longer be trusted for its intended purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Revocation process\n",
    "1. **Revocation by the CA**  \n",
    "   The Certification Authority (CA) formally revokes the certificate and records it as invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Publication of revocation information**  \n",
    "   The CA periodically publishes a **Certificate Revocation List (CRL)**, which is a blacklist\n",
    "   of revoked certificates. Exceptional CRLs may also be published on a best-effort basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Distribution of revocation data**  \n",
    "   Certificate extensions typically include URLs indicating where CRLs can be obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Revocation checking by clients**  \n",
    "   Clients are expected to obtain and check the most recent revocation information before\n",
    "   accepting a certificate, although traditional client support for CRLs is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternative revocation mechanisms\n",
    "- **Trusted Service Provider Lists (TSL):** up-to-date whitelists of trusted certificates,\n",
    "  typically used in closed or high-security environments.\n",
    "- **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP):** a trusted online service that checks\n",
    "  revocation status on behalf of the client.\n",
    "- **Certificate pinning:** applications or browsers maintain their own whitelist of\n",
    "  acceptable certificates for specific entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "If revocation information indicates that a certificate is revoked, the client must reject it.\n",
    "\n"
