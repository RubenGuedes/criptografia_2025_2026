    "- ### 2.1: What does this tell you about the integrity of the file?\n",
    "The hash function acts as a \"fingerprint\" of the file: any modification, even a minor one, would completely change the hash value.Since the hash calculated is the same as the one given in the statement, we can thus conclude that the integrity of the file is maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### 2.1: How many bytes do you expect to be affected by this change?\n",
    "When you change the first 4 bytes of the PDF, the resulting hash will be completely different from the original. This is because the SHA-256 algorithm processes in blocks and each block influences the following ones.Thus, all the bytes of the hash change, even if only 4 bytes of the file have been modified."
